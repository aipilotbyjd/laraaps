# ✅ Organization Multi-Tenancy Setup Complete

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **1. Database Schema** ✅

- **User Model**: Added proper relationships (organization(), apiKeys(), etc.)
- Auto-generates UUID and slug for organizations
- Default limits configured (10 workflows, 1000 executions/month, 5 team members)

### **3. Registration Flow** ✅
- Creates organization automatically on user registration
- Sets user as owner with proper role
- Creates organization_members relationship
- Generates default variables (APP_NAME, APP_URL)
- Returns both user and organization data

### **4. Middleware** ✅
- Created `EnsureOrganizationContext` middleware
- Validates org_id presence
- Checks organization is active
- Adds organization to request attributes

### **5. All Services Updated** ✅
Services now properly handle org_id for multi-tenancy:
- WorkflowService
- ExecutionService
- CredentialService
- WebhookService
- VariableService
- NodeService
- TemplateService
- AnalyticsService

## 📊 Organization Structure

```sql
organizations table:
- id (UUID)
- name, slug (unique), description
- owner_id, email, website, logo
- timezone, currency, country
- settings (JSON), limits (JSON)
- plan (free/starter/pro/enterprise)
- trial_ends_at, is_active
- suspended_at, suspension_reason
- timestamps, soft deletes

organization_members table:
- organization_id, user_id
- role (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- permissions (JSON)
- invite tracking fields
- joined_at, timestamps

users table additions:
- org_id (UUID foreign key)
- role, status, avatar
- timezone, language
- two-factor fields
- last_login_at
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Organization Isolation**: All data is scoped by org_id
2. **Active Organization Check**: Suspended orgs cannot access API
3. **Plan Limits Enforcement**: Workflows, executions, team members
4. **Role-Based Access**: Owner, admin, member, viewer roles
5. **Soft Deletes**: Organizations can be recovered

## 🚀 Quick Test

### **1. Register New User**
```bash
curl -X POST http://laraaps.test/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123"
  }'
```

**Response includes:**
- User with org_id
- Organization details
- Access token
- Organization limits and settings

### **2. Access Workflows**
```bash
curl -X GET http://laraaps.test/api/v1/workflows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Returns workflows for user's organization only ✅

### **3. Create Workflow**
```bash
curl -X POST http://laraaps.test/api/v1/workflows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Workflow",
    "active": true,
    "nodes": [...],
    "connections": [...]
  }'
```

Automatically assigns org_id and user_id ✅

## 📈 Organization Features

### **Plan Limits**
```json
{
  "workflows": 10,
  "executions_per_month": 1000,
