## 🟡 Partially Completed Features

### Node Executors
**Available (20 types):** Start, Email, HttpRequest, If, Merge, Wait, Set, Filter, Split, Code, Loop, Aggregate, Sort, Limit, Switch, SubWorkflow, Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)  
**Missing:** Function, Transform (JSON/XML), Spreadsheet, FTP, SSH

## ⏳ Pending Features (By Priority)

### High Priority (Needed for Production)

1. **Frontend/UI** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - No visual workflow builder exists
   - Need Vue.js or React-based drag-and-drop editor
   - Canvas for node connection visualization
   - Node configuration panels

### Medium Priority (Important for Feature Parity)

2. **Service Method Implementations**
   - `WebhookService`: test(), getLogs(), getStats(), regenerateToken()
   - `CredentialService`: getTypes(), OAuth flows, test()
   - `NodeService`: getCategories(), getTags(), getSchema()

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Retry strategies for failed nodes
   - Error boundaries per node
   - Fallback paths

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Collaboration Service** - Real-time editing, presence awareness
2. **AI Service** - Workflow suggestions, error explanations
3. **Storage Service** - Multipart uploads, file sharing
4. **Template Marketplace** - Search, reviews, ratings

# Delete executions older than 30 days
php artisan workflows:cleanup-executions --days=30
```

### Trigger Workflow via Webhook
```bash
# POST to webhook endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/webhook/{workflow_id}/{path} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

### Monitor Executions

- Workflow execution start/completion
- Node-level execution timing
- Error stack traces

   - Encrypted credential storage with Crypt facade
   - Safe expression evaluation (no eval)
5. **Logging:** Structured logging with context for debugging
6. **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with proper error propagation
7. **Metrics:** Execution timing tracked at workflow and node level
8. **Caching:** Variable resolution with 5-minute cache TTL
9. **Reusability:** ResolvesVariables trait for DRY principle

## 📝 Next Steps Recommendation

**Priority Order:**
1. **Implement Frontend** ⚠️ **URGENT** - Only major feature missing for MVP
2. **Write Comprehensive Tests** - Unit and integration test suite
3. **Add Advanced Node Types** - Transform (JSON/XML), Spreadsheet, FTP, SSH
4. **Enhance Analytics** - Add cost tracking and custom report generation
5. **Real-time Features** - WebSocket support for live execution updates

## 🐛 Known Issues

- `CodeNodeExecutor` uses `eval()` (documented security risk - PHP sandboxing is complex)
- No rate limiting on webhook endpoints (recommend Redis-based throttling)
- No execution queue prioritization (Laravel queue driver limitation)
- Memory and CPU metrics not tracked (requires process-level monitoring)
- Email view template (`resources/views/emails/workflow.blade.php`) may need creation
- Cost tracking in Analytics returns placeholder response (feature not prioritized)
